# Fountain

Fountain is a project that aims to create a shared list of Xbox accounts.   By utilizing the feature in Minecraft that displays games played by friends, we intend to use this as a means to connect with strangers and expand our gaming community.

## Project Goals
- Create a central repository for sharing Xbox accounts in the gaming community.
- Utilize the friends' games feature in Minecraft to connect with new players.
- Foster a sense of community and collaboration among gamers.

Thank you for your interest in the Fountain project.   Let's build a better gaming community together!
